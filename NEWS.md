# teproj 0.0.1.0000

+ Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
+ Between development version and current version, changed `filename` and `filepath` arguments
to `file` and `path` (to emulate more common terminology).
+ Removed `.` prefixes to internal functions. (Personal preference no longer
favors this syntax for non-API functions.)

Introduction
------------

This package contains functions that I use often in projects.

### Inspiration

The original purpose of this package was to provide a convenient interface to the `{readr}` and `{rio}` functions for importing and exporting data to various file formats. Because I often found myself using the variable name as the name of the file, I figured it would be nice to implement "lazy" methods for doing so. Under the hood, this packages's functions use "Non-Standared Evaluation" (NSE) (using techniques that may or may not be up to date with the latest `{tidyverse}` methods of NSE ðŸ˜„).

Additionally, while implementing these `import`/`export` functions, I realized a couple of other functions that I often use in projects (e.g. `render_proj_io()` could be added. (I don't necessarily recommend using these "other" functions, however, because they are tailored towards my use cases.)

### Syntax \[^readme\]

-   **`import_ext*()`** functions - Implement `{rio}`-like interface (note the use of the verb "import") for reading data from files. The main function is `import_ext()`, which requires that the file extension be specified with the `ext` paramater. Shorcuts for the extensions that I find myself using most often are implemented via the syntax `import_ext_[ext]()` (e.g. `import_ext_csv()`). Under the hood, preference is given to `{readr}` methods if they exist and can be recognized. (This is because it reads in `data.frame`s as `tibble`s by default. Otherwise, an attempt is made to use a `{rio}` method (with subsequent coercion to a `tibble`).

-   **`export_ext*()`** functions - Counterpart to the `import_ext_*()` functions. Notably, exporting of plots is supported. However, the support is not robust-- it is intended only for use with `ggplot2` plots, and only to the `png` file format. The `units`, `width`, and `height` are set to package option values (see `options("teproj.ggsave.units"`, etc.) if they are not all specified explicitly together.

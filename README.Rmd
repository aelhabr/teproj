##  Introduction

This package contains functions that I use often in projects.

## Installation

`remotes::install_github("tonyelhabr/teproj")`.

## Notes

Here is a list of all functions in the package.

```{r echo = FALSE}
library("teproj")
ls("package:teproj")
```

## Inspiration

The original purpose of this package was to provide a convenient interface
to the `{readr}` and `{rio}` functions for importing and exporting data to various file formats.
Because I often found myself using the variable name as the name of the file,
I figured it would be nice to implement "lazy" methods for doing so.
Under the hood, this packages's functions use "Non-Standared Evaluation" (NSE)
(using techniques that may or may
not be up to date with the latest `{tidyverse}` methods of NSE `r emo::ji("smile")`).

Additionally, while implementing these `import`/`export` functions,
I realized a couple of other functions that I often
use in projects could be added.
(I don't necessarily recommend using these "other" functions, however, because they 
are tailored towards my use cases.)


```{r covrg, include = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
covrg <- covr::package_coverage()
print(covrg)
```

## Syntax

+ __`import_ext*()`__ functions - Implement `{rio}`-like interface (note the use
of the verb "import") for reading data from files.
The main function is `import_ext()`, which requires that the file extension be specified with
the `ext` paramater. Shorcuts for the extensions that I find myself using most often
are implemented via the syntax `import_ext_[ext]()` (e.g. `import_ext_csv()`).
Under the hood, preference is given to `{readr}` methods if they exist and can be recognized.
(This is because it reads in `data.frame`s as `tibble`s by default.
Otherwise, an attempt is made to use a `{rio}` method (with subsequent coercion to a `tibble`).

+ __`export_ext*()`__ functions - Counterpart to the `import_ext_*()` functions.
Notably, exporting of plots is supported. However, the support is not robust--
it is intended only for use with `ggplot2` plots, and only to the `png` file format.
